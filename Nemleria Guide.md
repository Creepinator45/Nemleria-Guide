## Introduction

The Dreaming Nemlaria archetype wants to clear out its extra deck face down, then summon Dreaming Nemlaria to wipe the opponent's board and GY, then finally finish the game with your {emph}(beat sticks). Think of the deck as sleeping on 15 layers of pillows, you need to remove the pillows to wake up Nemleria! While by no means a competitively viable deck, it is fun to **whip it out** during a casual game. Today, I will guide you on how to win with the deck, and how to be a master at *RELEASING THE BEAST!!!*

The deck debuted in the Indomitable Pride

{tabbed: Core, ED + Tech, Sample Decklists}

## Core Cards: 

{2col}

{cards}(Dreaming Nemleria@3)

###### Dreaming Nemlaira - {emph}(3x)

The goal is to get her face up in the extra deck and to **NOT** banish her face down. You achieve this most of the time with her pendulum effect. Once you can summon her and use her {emph}(board wipe), you can {emph}(recover) your extra deck monsters to go into {Linkuriboh} and return her to the extra deck, and Rank 10s, such as {Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max}. This is also why you do not want to play clutter in the extra deck since Nemlaria returning cards is crucial in the deck. She also has a restriction that prevents you from summoning her the same turn you put her in the extra deck with her affect, though putting her in the extra deck with other card affects can bypass this restriction.

{2coldiv}

{cards}(Sweet Dreams, Nemleria@3)

###### Sweet Dreams, Nemleria - {emph}(3x)

The card is a generic {emph}(searcher) that will search for any Nemleria monster. If you already have Nemleria face-up in the extra deck, Sweet Dreams allows you to resolve Nemleria's effect without the worry of a response from your opponent. You can also return Dreaming Nemleria to the extra with the GY effect once Nemleria is summoned if you do not want or can not link summon Linkuriboh. As for what to search, search for Dreaming Nemleria or, if you already have her, a rank 10 (My personal option is Reveil).

{2colend}

{2col}

{cards}(Dream Tower of Princess Nemleria)

###### Dream Tower of Princess Nemleria - {emph}(2x)

Running 2 of this card is pretty standard. The card is huge since it works towards the goal of clearing the extra deck and {emph}(searches) *2* level 10s from the deck.  Most of the time, you will search Reveil and Couette. It also protects your Nemleria monsters from destruction by battle or card affect.

{2coldiv}

{cards}(Nemleria Dream Devourer - Reveil)

###### Nemleria Dream Devourer - Reveil - {emph}(2-3x)

Every level 10 has a job related to the extra deck in some way. Reveil's job is to thin out the extra deck. It {emph}(banishes) 3 cards from the extra deck and can be summoned from the GY once it is destroyed or {emph}(detached) as XYZ material. It is well advised to go into this card ASAP. Reveil can also search for a trap, at the cost of discarding a level 10. 

{2colend}

{2col}

{cards}(Nemleria Dream Defender - Couette)

###### Nemleria Dream Defender - Couette {emph}(2-3x)

Couette's job is to {emph}(negate) cards that target your Nemleria monsters (but **ONLY** when Dreaming Nemleria is in your ED). While not the best negate or an omni negate, it gets the job done. It also thins your extra deck.

{2coldiv}

{cards}(Nemleria Dream Defender - Oreiller)

###### Nemleria Dream Defender - Oreiller {emph}(1-2x)

Oreiller's (or just call him Oreo) job is to thin the extra deck while being a {emph}(beat stick). Oreo is easily the worst Nemleria monster, but can be critical for getting the last extra deck card banished.

{2colend}

{2col}

{cards}(Dreaming Reality of Nemleria, Realized)

###### Dreaming Reality of Nemleria, Realized {emph}(1-3x)

Realized's goal is to add Dreaming Nemleria to the extra deck, bypassing her turn 1 summon restriction. The {Book of Moon} effect is also useful.

{2coldiv}

{cards}(Nemleria Repeter)

###### Nemleria Repeter {emph}(1-2x)

The traps are situational, and you will use both at one point or another.
 Repeter's {Dark Ruler No More} like effect can give you a massive advantage, and its {emph}(recycle) effect is good.

{2colend}

{2col}

{cards}(Nemleria Louve)

###### Nemleria Louve {emph}(1x)

You can use this card over Repeter if don't have the extra deck or beast monsters to support repeter's negate.
 Louve can {emph}(special summon) a Nemleria monster. Typically this will be Realized to either put Nemleria in the ED or to use as a book of moon.

{2colend}

{cards}(Pot of Extravagance; Pot of Prosperity)

###### Pot of Extravagance and Pot of Prosperity {emph}(1x)

Both extra deck banishing pots are auto-includes for nemleria decks, giving you draw power as well as helping to empty your extra deck. Play as many copies as you can.

{tabsep}

## Extra Deck

The extra does not matter all too much and you probably won't be summoning anything from it until turn 3 or later. However you should still run the extra deck on the off chance it comes in handy. Also, some nemleria decks can choose to run a 12 card extra deck to try to turbo out Dreaming Nemleria easier, but it's not required.

{3col}

{cards}(Gravity Controller)

###### Gravity Controller

This card is used to retrieve Dreaming Nemleria to the Extra Deck for later turns. This card can be replaced by other cards. Such cards are:

- {Linkuriboh}
- {Relinquished Anima}

Run 2 copies of whichever card you choose.

{3coldiv}

{cards}(Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max)

###### Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max

The card uses the level 10 beasts you summoned earlier to get 2000 {emph}(burn damage). Since the deck is mostly beat sticks anyway, chipping 2000 damage can help a bit. I recommend you run 2 copies.

{3coldiv}

{cards}(Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe)

###### Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe

Once you are done with your rank 10s, rank up into Liebe. This card is the ultimate beat stick and can finish games easily with a naked board. Even if you do not finish the game on that turn, the opponent will be weak enough for you to win later. You will only need 1 copy.

{3colend}

{3col}

{cards}(Skypalace Gangaridai)

###### Skypalace Gangaridai

Skypalace does the same job as Gustav Max. It burns for 1000, but it lets you pop a card. You would immediately rank up into Liebe or Pain Gainer. Play 1 copy of the card.

{3coldiv}

{cards}(Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora)

###### Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora

Having a card to protect your Dreaming Nemleria and other monsters for future turns is significant. The situation with the card is rare, however. Run 1 copy.

{3coldiv}

{cards}(Number 84: Pain Gainer)

###### Number 84: Pain Gainer

A great alternative for Liebe if you're short on UR. Even if you have the card, still run this. The card is a great {emph}(burn card) that can wipe the board easily. Run 1 copy. 

{3colend}

{2col}

{cards}(Number 35: Ravenous Tarantula)

###### Number 35: Ravenous Tarantula

The sister of Pain Gainer is the polar opposite of the Rank 11. It destroys cards with lower ATK instead of defense and {emph}(burns) each time a monster effect is activated. Run 1 copy.

{2coldiv}

{cards}(Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder)

###### Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder

An obvious choice in any deck that has XYZ monsters. Zeus can take an already advantageous board, and turn it into an imminent win. 

{2colend}

Quick note: You should run multiple copies of cards you want to use in the ED if you use {Pot of Extravagance}.

To fill up the extra deck, you can run these cards. The rest of the extra deck is up to the builder.

{cards}(Knightmare Unicorn; Knightmare Phoenix; Knightmare Cerberus; Knightmare Gryphon; Accesscode Talker; Underworld Goddess of the Closed World; Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy)

## Tech Cards

These cards can be thrown in if you need to fill up the deck. They don't fit into every build, but can enhance aspects of the deck to your advantage.



{3col}

{cards}(Pot of Desires)

###### Pot of Desires {emph}(1x)

The card when paired with Eater of Millions and {Gren Maju Da Eiza}, can give boosts to both monsters, and can give Dreaming Nemleria more banishes on summon. Also, you can {emph}(draw 2). This card can lose Dreaming Nemleria for the entire duel, so it's a high-risk high-reward card.

{3coldiv}

{cards}(Gren Maju Da Eiza@3)

###### Gren Maju De Eiza {emph}(1-3x)

The card is a great beat stick that works perfectly with the deck and Eater of Millions. With the cards you banish face down, Gren Maju can be boosted to 5000 ATK and beat over most monsters you will encounter. To note, Gren Maju is only used in Blind Second Dekcs.

{3coldiv}

{cards}(Lava Golem@3)

###### Lava Golem {emph}(1-3x)

Lava Golem is great {emph}(removal) that does not go against the deck. You do not need to settle for Kaijus when you can use a monster that tributes 2 monsters and use the burn damage in the Standby Phase. This card is used in Side Decks and Blind Second Decks.

{3colend}

{2col}

{cards}(Pendulum Treasure@3)

###### Pendulum Treasure {emph}(2-3x)

Pendulum Treasure allows you to easily add Dreaming Nemlaria to the extra deck while bypassing it's turn 1 summon restriction. The card is especially powerful with {Triple Tactics Thrust}. The card is a brick, however, if you already have Dreaming Nemleria access.

{2coldiv}

{cards}(Eater of Millions@3)

###### Eater of Millions {emph}(3x)

The card can clear the entire Extra Deck with one card and get rid of bricks in your hand. The card also can clear one monster from your opponents during the Battle Phase.

{2colend}

### Small world:

{cards}(Small World@3; PSY-Framegear Delta@2; PSY-Framegear Gamma@2; PSY-Frame Driver; Fairy Tail - Luna@2;)

Small world is useful for having more consistent Dreaming Nemleria access, or for searching for other engines or tech cards. The most common bridges are the PSY-frames as they can bridge almost any card in the deck to Dreaming Nemleria. Fairy Tail - Luna is specifically useful for bridging to either Dreaming Nemleria or Water Enchantress for the adventure engine.

## Unpopular Tech Options

{cards}(Gizmek Orochi, the Serpentron Sky Slasher)

###### Gizmek Orochi, the Serpentron Sky Slasher {emph}(1-2x)

This card has a high maintenance cost but can give a decent advantage. The card can pop while thinning out the extra deck. Also, when paired with {Eater of Millions}, it can give the monster a large boost. Too much cost for the reward, however. 

{cards}(Banquet of Millions)

###### Banquet of Millions {emph}(1-2x)

This card is difficult to use correctly, as you need to activate it on your turn, which ruins the whole disruption part of it. Overall, Eater of Millions is millions of times better than the lousy trap (no pun intended).

{cards}(Mound of the Bound Creator; Earthbound Immortal Cusillu)

###### Mound of the Bound Creator and Earthbound Immortal Cusillu {emph}(1x)

Such a silly tech option. You use the field spell to give added effects to your rank 10s. Also could go well with {The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode} Cusillu is a level 10 beast, which means it is searchable and can eventually be summoned. But, just do not run these two piles of trash.

## Engines

### *Adventure Engine*

{cards}(Water Enchantress of the Temple; Rite of Aramesir@2; Wandering Gryphon Rider; Fateful Adventure; Dracoback, the Rideable Dragon)

Without the use of a {emph}(Normal Summon) (Which Dreaming Nemleria does not need) you can get an Omni negate and a {emph}(bounce). You would activate Rite of Aremiser to get the token, then use Fateful Adventure to search and summon the Omni Negate.

### *Condemned Witch Engine*

{cards}(Condemned Witch@2; Forbidden Droplet@2; Barrier Statue of the Heavens)

With your Normal Summon, you can summon Condemned Witch to add Forbidden Droplet. This gives you a {emph}(negate) that gets rid of bricks, and can {emph}(floodgate) with the barrier statue.

### *Dogmatika Engine*

{cards}(Nadir Servant@3; Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous@3; Dogmatika Maximus@1; Dogmatika Punishment@2; Dogmatika Fleurdelis, the Knighted; Elder Entity N'tss@2; Garura, Wings of Resonant Life@2; Titaniklad the Ash Dragon)

(Explained by {@Creepinator45:63fee76b5a727c5eff522fd4}) Nadir Servant is a {emph}(search) card that can send Garura to draw 1 card. It can also send Titaninklad to search for Fleurdelis. You will search Ecclesia. Eclessia searches for Punishment, Fleurdelis, or Maximus. Punishment {emph}(pops) 2 cards with sending N'tss to the GY. Fleurdelis can give you a {emph}(negate), and will usable be searched if you already have Punishment. Maximus is summoned by what you sent with Nadir Servant. You can use the remaining extra deck space to add the Fusion Monsters. 

## Floodgates

If you are the type of person who likes floodgates, these cards are perfect for you to play.

{cards}(Barrier Statue of the Heavens; Gozen Match; Rivalry of Warlords; Summon Limit@2; Majesty's Fiend; Dimension Shifter@2; Dimensional Fissure@3; Inspector Boarder; Dimensional Barrier)

- Barrier Statue works because we mostly use {emph}(light attributed) monsters in the main deck. This also applies to {Gozen Match}.
- Rivalry of Warlords works because we mostly use beasts.
- Summon Limit works because we do not summon that many times per turn.
- Majesty's fiend works as a normal floodgate while we finish the opponent off with beat sticks. It is the same story for {Skill Drain}, {Inspector Boarder}, and {Vanity's Fiend}.
- D Shifter and D Fissure work because Nemleria does not need the Graveyard 90% of the time.
- D Barrier works because we do not need the Extra Deck.
